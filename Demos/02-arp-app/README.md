# Register a web application with the Application Registration Portal

In this demo, you will create a new Azure AD web application registration using the Application Registry Portal (ARP).

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [Application Registry Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com). Login using a **personal account** (aka: Microsoft Account) or **Work or School Account**.

1. Select **Add an app** at the top of the page.

    > **Note:** If you see more than one **Add an app** button on the page, select the one that corresponds to the **Converged apps** list.

1. On the **Register your application** page, set the **Application Name** to **Ruby on Rails Graph Tutorial** and select **Create**.
